  <h1>Nike Blazers</h1>

<h2>Origins and History</h2>

  <p>This sneaker was originally worn by NBA star George "The Iceman" Gervin. This exposed NBA fans to the Nike brand for the first time.[2] The brand, based in Beaverton, Oregon, gave the shoe the name “Blazer” after its regional NBA team the Portland Trail Blazers.[3] The original shoe was made out of three main components, the upper portion of the shoe was made up of leather, the tongue was made up of nylon and the midsole consisted of rubber just like most sneakers use today.[4][5] At this point in time, other sneaker giants were also breaking into the NBA with their own basketball sneakers and basketball stars to market them such as Julius Erving with Converse and Walt Frazier with Puma. This meant that Nike had competition in this field.[6] The young company had only been around for nine years when introducing the Blazer, starting as Blue Ribbon Sports and, in 1971, taking on the name Nike and it's well-known Swoosh logo.[3] Nevertheless, Nike was well prepared to compete with the other industry giants and that could be attributed to the fact that the Nike Blazer possessed the best technology for basketball shoes at the time.[4] The Nike Blazer is still available in the sneaker market in a low and mid-top.</p>



<h2>Nike SB</h2>
  <p>In 2005, the Nike spokesperson Lance Mountain released the Nike Blazer SB which was a design with new features such as a padded collar and insoles where Nike implemented their Zoom Air technology to accommodate skaters. The first Nike Blazer SB, released in May, carried a very dark look with an all black suede upper and a black mid-sole that was made thicker than what the original basketball shoe had. The swoosh and laces were a baroque brown which completed the first SB version of the Blazer.[7] Therefore, although the Nike Blazer was originally created for the sport of basketball, since then it became a part of the Nike SB (Skateboarding) sub brand and is currently marketed towards the skateboarding community.[8]</p>

<h2>Collaborations</h2>

<p>The Nike Blazer has remained relevant in today's sneaker culture, not only for skaters but also for everyday casual sneaker users. This could be directly attributed to the numerous collaborations Nike has done with other clothing brands to create new Blazer colorways. </p>

<h3>Nike Blazer x Off-White</h3>
<p> Off-White is an American luxury fashion brand founded in 2012.

In September 2017, the first collaboration happened between the two and "The Ten" Nike Blazer came to be. This shoe has a white upper with an white/tan mid-sole all brought together by the black Nike Swoosh.[9]

This shoe is the most colorful of all the shoes thus far, with a wolf grey upper while the heel and tongue are white. This shoe's mid-sole is pink and purple with a fade effect and a black swoosh.[10]

In October 2018, Nike and Off-white teamed up to create two Nike Blazers. The "All Hollows Eve" consists of a pale vanilla upper while the swoosh is in bright yellow-orange.[11] The "Grim Reapers" consist of an 'clone black' while the mid-sole and upper toe is black, this shoe features orange accents in order to give it that classic Nike look.</p>
