<p> Converse (/ˈkɒnvərs/) is an American shoe company that designs, distributes, and licenses sneakers, skating shoes, lifestyle brand footwear, apparel, and accessories. Founded in 1908, it has been a subsidiary of Nike, Inc. since 2003.[2]

During World War II, Converse shifted its manufacturing to make footwear for the military.[3] It was one of the few producers of athletic shoes and for over a half century the company dominated the American athletic shoe market. From the 1970s, the company lost its dominant position as competitors presented their own styles.

Today the company's portfolio include products under the Converse, Cons, Chuck Taylor All-Star ("Chucks"), Jack Purcell, One Star, and Star Chevron trademarks.[4] Converse frequently collaborates on special edition product releases with other brands such as John Varvatos. Converse shoes are distinguished by a number of features, including the company's star insignia, the All Star's rubber sole, smooth rounded toe, and wrap-around strip.

As of 2019, Converse sold products through 109 company-owned retail stores in the United States and 63 stores in international markets.[4] Early years
Forty-seven-year-old Marquis Mills Converse, a manager at a footwear manufacturing firm, opened the Converse Rubber Shoe Company in February 1908 in Malden, Massachusetts.[5] The company was a rubber shoe manufacturer, providing winterized rubber-soled footwear for men, women, and children. By 1910, Converse was producing shoes daily, but it was not until 1915 that the company began manufacturing athletic shoes.[6]

In 1918, the Converse All-Star basketball shoe was introduced.[5] Then in 1923, a basketball player named Charles H. "Chuck" Taylor walked into Converse complaining of sore feet. Converse gave him a job: he worked as a salesman and ambassador, promoting the shoes around the U.S., and in 1932 Taylor's signature was added to the All-Star patch on the classic, high-topped sneakers. He continued this work until shortly before his death in 1969.[7] Converse also customized shoes for the New York Renaissance (the "Rens"), the first all–African American professional basketball team. In 1962, center Wilt Chamberlain of the Philadelphia Warriors scored 100 points in an NBA game while wearing a pair of Chucks, taking a 169–147 victory over the New York Knicks in Hershey, Pennsylvania on March 2.[8]

<p> 1941–2001: War, rise, bankruptcy, and new management
When the U.S. entered World War II in 1941, Converse shifted production to manufacturing rubberized footwear, outerwear, and protective suits for the military. The company resumed production of athletic footwear after the war's end. Popular during the 1950s and 1960s, Converse promoted an American image with its Converse Basketball Yearbook. Artist Charles Kerins created cover art that celebrated Converse's role in the lives of high school and college athletes.[citation needed]

In the 1970s, Converse bought out one of its biggest competitors at the time, PF Flyers, from B.F. Goodrich. This led to a monopoly in the shoe market that in 1975 both brands had to split due to an anti-trust lawsuit. Despite both brands being split, Converse had kept the trademark rights of the Jack Purcell line it had purchased from the PF Flyers acquisition.[clarification needed] Jack Purcell shoes are still produced and sold today.[9]

Converse lost their monopoly from the 1970s onward, with new competitors, including Puma, Adidas, and Nike. A decade later, as Reebok introduced new designs and technology to the sports market, Converse was no longer the official shoe of the National Basketball Association (NBA).[10]

The chevron and star insignia — a logo that remains on a large portion of Converse footwear other than the All Star — was created by Jim Labadini, an employee.[11]

Canvas-rubber shoes regained popularity in the 1980s as casual footwear, but Converse eventually became too dependent on the "All Stars" brand, whose market collapsed by 1989–1990. By 2000, Converse was slipping repeatedly into receivership as debt piled up yearly.[12]

Converse filed for bankruptcy on January 22, 2001. Not too long after, on March 30, its last manufacturing plants in the U.S., closed down, as production fully moved overseas.[13] In April 2001, Footwear Acquisitions, led by Marsden Cason and Bill Simon, purchased the brand from bankruptcy and added industry partners Jack Boys, Jim Stroesser, Lisa Kempa, and David Maddocks to lead the turnaround.[14]

During this period, Converse moved its headquarters from North Reading, Massachusetts to North Andover, Massachusetts. The company was located in the town of North Andover for thirteen years.[15]

Acquisition by Nike
In July 2003, Nike paid $309 million to acquire Converse.[2] Around 2010, Nike relaunched the footwear, taking advantage of the wave of 1980s revival. The company also expanded the Converse brand to other businesses apart from shoes, much akin to its other brands.[citation needed][clarification needed]

By November 2012, Converse had disappeared completely from the NBA, as the last dozen players wearing the brand either left the NBA or switched shoes over a period of a year and a half. Carlos Arroyo went overseas in late 2011, and Maurice Evans last played for the Washington Wizards in April 2012. Nine switched to Nike: Acie Law (who went overseas) in late 2011; JJ Barea and Kirk Hinrich during the 2011–12 season; Luke Harangody and Larry Sanders after the season; Elton Brand, Louis Williams, and Kyle Korver for the 2012–13 season; and Chris Andersen during the season. Udonis Haslem, the last NBA player wearing Converse on the court, followed Miami Heat teammate Dwyane Wade to switch to Li-Ning in late November 2012.[16]

In 2019, Converse returned to the performance basketball scene with the All-Star Pro BB. Kelly Oubre Jr. was the first player to try out the new product,[17] which combined the traditional Converse silhouette with the contemporary Nike technology. Thereafter Converse signed more players: Draymond Green in March 2020,[18] Natasha Cloud (the first WNBA player) in June 2020,[19] Shai Gilgeous-Alexander in July 2020,[20] and, more recently, Rudy Gay, P. J. Tucker, DeAndre' Bembry, De'Anthony Melton, Nickeil Alexander-Walker, Immanuel Quickley, Deividas Sirvydis.[21]

Celebrities who have worn Converse include Snoop Dogg, Kristen Stewart, Rihanna, and Tyler, the Creator. The growth of Converse as a casual fashion accessory contributed to $1.7 billion in revenue in 2014 and $2 billion in 2015.[22] </p>
