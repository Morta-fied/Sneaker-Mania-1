  <h1>Nike Air Max </h1>

  <p>Nike Air Max is a line of shoes produced by Nike, Inc., with the first model released in 1987. Air Max shoes are identified by their midsoles incorporating flexible urethane pouches filled with pressurized gas, visible from the exterior of the shoe and intended to provide cushioning to the underfoot. Air Max was conceptualized by Tinker Hatfield, who initially worked for Nike designing stores.[1]</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

  <p>As the name indicates, all Air Max shoes feature one or more translucent pouches of pressurized gas embedded in the midsole and visible from the outside of the shoe. Referred to as "Air units" or "airbags," their stated purpose is to provide superior cushioning to traditional foam while also reducing weight. The effectiveness of the technology for this purpose is disputed; nevertheless, the shoes enjoy consistent popularity, especially among sneaker enthusiasts and collectors.

The size, design, and number of air units varies within the product line; the "retro" Air Max 1 simply includes one small unit under the heel, while in the contemporary Air VaporMax, effectively the entire midsole is composed of air units with no conventional foam present.

About 1980, Frank Rudy an aeronautical engineer first captured the high density urethane gas. He presented Nike the concept of cushioning midsole while reducing the weight. Today Air Max is one of the most popular sneaker around the globe.[2]</p>



<h2>Culture and fashion</h2>
  <p>The line of sneakers is popular amongst many subcultures, for example hip hop and gabber.[3] In the mid-1990s the line, especially the Air Max 99 model, experienced such a surge of popularity in Japan that it led to a phenomenon known as "Air Max hunting". The extremely inflated prices of the shoes led to a rash of muggings in the normally-peaceful country wherein Air Max wearers were attacked and their shoes were stolen. Even used shoes were in demand, and fakes also became a problem.[4]</p>

<h2>Models</h2>
<h3>Air Max 95</h3>
<p>The visual design of the Air Max 95 was created by Sergio Lozano, who based the design of the Air Max 95 on the human anatomy, with the spine of the shoe resembling the human spine and the materials intended to represent skin, ribs, and tendons.[10] The Air Max 95 was the first pair in the line to utilize two air cushions in the forefoot and used air pressure technology to fit the curvature of the wearer's forefoot.[11] The first colorway was black, neon yellow and white. Neon yellow was used to emphasize the multiple air units. The shoe also introduced a smaller Nike swoosh minimized in the rear side panel. Original releases featured a "25 PSI" air pressure reading on the rear air unit. Uppers also featured 3M Scotchlite material.[12]

The product was referenced in the hip hop song "Hate It or Love It" by The Game, which was a worldwide top 10 hit in 2005. Also referenced by rappers Gucci Mane in the hit single "Bricks" and Waka Flocka Flame on the track "Head First" in his 2009 mixtape, "Lebron Flocka James". The rapper Eminem designed a limited-edition range of Air Maxes sold for charity.[13]</p>

<h3>Air Max Plus Tuned</h3>
<p>Released in 1998, the Air Max Plus introduced Nike's Tuned Air system.[15], and as such became retrospectively known as the Air Max TN, Air Max Tuned, or Air Max Tuned 1 (TN1). Designed by Sean McDowell, the Air Max Plus featured transverse waves inspired by palm trees, and a prominent arch shank inspired by a whale tail. The initial release featured a "Hyper Blue" colorway, characterized by a fading blue airbrush effect. The Nike swoosh had a slightly irregular appearance as a border was added along the inner edge, as opposed to the outer surface.[16] Although the shoe only had modest success in North America,[17] in Europe they were massively popular - particularly in France, where the Plus grew to enjoy iconic status[18] among youth culture in Paris and Marseille, where the shoe has the nickname Le Requin ("The Shark") - often anglicised into "Rekin".[19] Part of the shoe's appeal is both its exclusivity (for many years it was only available from Foot Locker stores) and its high price. In some areas of LGBT sub-culture in France and many other European nations (most notably Germany and the United Kingdom) the Plus/TN is one of the most coveted Air Max models among foot, sneaker and sportswear fetishists.[20]

Australia was another major market for the Air Max Plus - infamously the shoe became popular with gang culture and criminals,[21] to the point where wearers of the shoe were banned from some pubs[22] and clubs.</p>

<h3>Air Max 360</h3>
<p>On January 21, 2006 Nike launched the Air Max 360, a new shoe design that utilized Max Air throughout the shoe's midsole. In September 2006 Nike introduced a special 'one time only pack' which fused the 360 model with three classics. The three shoes used were the Air Max 90, Air Max 95, and Air Max 97. For this special release, the design of the 360 sole was used in place of the normal sole of the three classics. The shoes were released in the three original colors: red for the Air Max 90, green/yellow for the Air Max 95, and grey/silver for the Air Max 97. Like other Air Max releases, deluxe editions were also produced. These deluxe editions lasted for about 500 miles (800 km) before their shock-absorbing properties deteriorated. The use of '360' of air cushioning is meant to ensure the shoe's longevity.</p>
