  <h1>Adidas Superstars & Sambas</h1>
  <h2>Adidas Superstars</h2>
  <p><b>The Superstar is a low-top athletic shoe manufactured by German multinational company Adidas since 1969. The shoe was originally released as a low-top version of the Pro Model basketball shoe.[1] The design is nicknamed the "clam-toe", "shell-toe", "shell shoes", "shell tops", and "sea shells" (along with Adicolor).
When the Superstar was introduced, it was the first low-top basketball shoe to feature an all-leather upper and rubber shell-toe. With its rubber toe protection and non-marking sole, the shoe caught the attention of NCAA and NBA players, most notably Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. Within the first few years of production, the Superstar was being worn by more than 75% of all NBA players.[2] Over the course of the next few years, it advanced from the court to the streets and, consequently, into the public's consciousness.

In 1983, the rap group Run-D.M.C. balked at traditional pop standard costuming by opting to wear regular street clothes on stage. The trio wore Superstars without any laces with the tongue of the shoe pushed out. "Adidas itself only found out about this love story when the band held up the 3-Stripes shoes during a concert in front of 40,000 fans – one of these concertgoers was an Adidas employee."[3] The rap group continued to wear Superstars on their US concert tour, which increased sales. Responding to an anti-sneaker rap song by Jerrald Deas called "Felon Sneakers", the trio released a song of their own called "My Adidas" in 1986.[4] The song paid tribute to the Superstar shoe, and attempted to flip the stereotype of the 'b-boy'. Adidas eventually signed an advertising deal with Run-D.M.C. which was first endorsement deal between hip-hop artists and a major corporation. The brand subsequently released a Run-D.M.C. clothing line.[4]

The Superstar has become part of popular youth fashion culture and is now worn as casual footwear, rather than for sports. Like Converse's Chuck Taylor All-Stars, the Superstar made the transition from the basketball court to street, sported by hip-hop aficionados. In the early 1980s, 'b-boys' wore the shoes with extra thick laces called "fat laces", often matching the color of the laces with the color of the stripes on their shoe.The Superstar (now known officially as the "Superstar II" as the current production shape differs from the original) are now sold in Adidas Originals stores, with new colors and designs including themes such as NBA teams and major US cities.
35th Anniversary Series
In 2005, Adidas collaborated with pop icons from the world of music, fashion, and the arts to create the Adidas 35th Anniversary collection[5] which included 35 different models from five different series.[6]

<h2>Adidas Sambas</h2>
Adidas Samba is an athletic shoe manufactured by German multinational Adidas. It is among Adidas' most popular shoes, being the second highest selling Adidas design ever with over 35 million pairs sold worldwide, behind the Stan Smith model.[1] It has been produced in a variety of color schemes, yet the original black with three white stripes is by far the most popular. The shoe features a tan gumsole that distinguishes it from other Adidas shoes.
The shoe was first produced in 1949 to enable football players to train on icy, hard ground (hence the suction design on the gumsole). Its original design featured the classic three stripes, as well as the gold trefoil on the foldable tongue. As years progressed, the Samba evolved into the Samba Millennium (which was made without the extended tongue) and the Samba '85. Classic models of the shoe are still in production, under the name Classic M. The original model is sometimes used for training, street play, and futsal.
The popularity of the Adidas Samba as a soccer shoe has caused it to move into popular culture, mostly worn as a fashion sneaker, and it makes many appearances in movies and on television. Some of these appearances include:
